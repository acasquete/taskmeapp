# TaskMe: Your Natural Kanban Board Experience

Welcome to the official repository of TaskMe, the Kanban board application designed to bring the intuitive and natural feel of a physical Kanban board into the digital realm. TaskMe stands out from other applications by mirroring all the actions you'd expect from a physical board, effortlessly. Our mission is to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience that enhances your productivity and collaboration, whether you're managing personal tasks or working in a team.

## Features

TaskMe comes packed with a variety of features designed to make your task management as intuitive and natural as a physical board:

- **Customizable Notes**: Create notes in 2 different sizes and choose from 6 bright colors to make your board vibrant and organized.
- **Colored Dots**: Add dots in 3 distinct colors to your notes for additional categorization or priority marking.
- **Easy Stage Creation**: Simply draw a vertical line to the right of the last stage to create new stages as your project expands.
- **Rename Stages**: Customize the names of your stages to reflect the specific needs of your project or workflow.
- **In Progress Indicator**: Automatically highlights the 'In Progress' stage when it exceeds 3 tasks, helping you keep track of workload distribution.
- **Export Board**: Save your board as a PNG file for easy sharing or to keep a record of your progress.
- **Multiple Boards**: Switch between up to 5 boards using Cmd+Number shortcuts, ensuring you can manage multiple projects with ease.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Work with others on the same board in real-time, making teamwork seamless and efficient.
- **Local and Cloud Storage**: Boards are saved locally, but logging in with Google allows you to save and retrieve your boards from any device, ensuring your data is always accessible.

## Background

TaskMe was initially developed in 2012 for the Windows Store on Windows, utilizing WinJS. The primary goal was to demonstrate the ease of porting a traditional web application to a Windows Store application. The original code can be found in the `legacy-windows-store` branch for those interested in exploring the application's origins.

TaskMe is a name rooted in inspiration, designed to transform task management into a journey of personal and collective growth. The term "Task" signifies our daily efforts and the opportunities they present for advancement, while "Me" emphasizes the app's personalized approach, encouraging users to take control of their tasks and projects. This blend of personal empowerment and collaborative effort invites users to see beyond the mundane, fostering a philosophy that combines productivity with a deeper sense of purpose.
