# TaskMe: Your Natural Kanban Board Experience

Welcome to the official repository of TaskMe, the Kanban board application designed to bring the intuitive and natural feel of a physical Kanban board into the digital realm. TaskMe stands out from other applications by mirroring all the actions you'd expect from a physical board, effortlessly. Our mission is to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience that enhances your productivity and collaboration, whether you're managing personal tasks or working in a team.

## Features

- **Colored Dots**: Add dots in 3 distinct colors to your notes for additional categorization or priority marking.
- **Easy Stage Creation**: Simply draw a vertical line to the right of the last stage to create new stages as your project expands.
- **Rename Stages**: Customize the names of your stages to reflect the specific needs of your project or workflow.
- **In Progress Indicator**: Automatically highlights the 'In Progress' stage when it exceeds 3 tasks, helping you keep track of workload distribution.

- **Multiple Boards**: Switch between up to 5 boards using Cmd+Number shortcuts, ensuring you can manage multiple projects with ease.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Work with others on the same board in real-time, making teamwork seamless and efficient.

## Background

TaskMe was initially developed in 2012 for the Windows Store on Windows, utilizing WinJS. The primary goal was to demonstrate the ease of porting a traditional web application to a Windows Store application. The original code can be found in the `legacy-windows-store` branch for those interested in exploring the application's origins.
